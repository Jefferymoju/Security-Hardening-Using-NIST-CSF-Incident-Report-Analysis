# Security Hardening Using NIST CSF – Incident Report Analysis  

## Objective  
To analyze and document a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) incident using the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). The goal was to identify weaknesses, strengthen defenses, and improve the organization’s ability to respond to and recover from future attacks.  

## Scope  
- Investigated a **DDoS ICMP flood attack** that disrupted the organization’s internal network for two hours.  
- Applied the **NIST CSF** functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.  
- Assessed misconfigured firewall settings and network vulnerabilities that enabled the attack.  
- Recommended improvements to network monitoring, access control, and incident response planning.  

## Tools and Methods  
- **Firewall Configuration & Rulesets** – Implemented filtering for ICMP traffic and enabled source IP verification.  
- **Network Monitoring Software** – Used to detect abnormal traffic patterns and bandwidth spikes.  
- **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)** – Configured to detect and block malicious ICMP packets.  
- **Log Analysis** – Reviewed network and firewall logs to trace the attack vector and assess impact.  
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** – Structured the analysis and remediation plan across Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.  

## Skills Learned  
- Applying the **NIST CSF** to real-world security incidents.  
- Configuring **firewall rules** to mitigate DDoS vulnerabilities.  
- Detecting and analyzing suspicious **network traffic patterns**.  
- Implementing **defense-in-depth strategies** using IDS/IPS systems.  
- Enhancing **incident response planning** and recovery procedures.  

## Files  
- **Incident_Report.md** – Detailed breakdown of the DDoS attack and investigation.  
- **NIST_CSF_Analysis.md** – Structured analysis mapped to the five CSF functions.  
- **Firewall_Configuration.docx** – Documentation of updated firewall rules and policies.  
- **Network_Logs_Summary.txt** – Extracts of key log entries used in analysis.  
- **Reflection_Notes.md** – Lessons learned and recommendations for future improvements.
