# Security Hardening Using NIST CSF – Incident Report Analysis  

## Objective  
To analyze and document a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) incident using the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF). The goal was to identify weaknesses, strengthen defenses, and improve the organization’s ability to respond to and recover from future attacks.  

## Scope  
- Investigated a **DDoS ICMP flood attack** that disrupted the organization’s internal network for two hours.  
- Applied the **NIST CSF** functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.    
- Recommended improvements to network monitoring, access control, and incident response planning.  

## Tools and Methods    
- **Log Analysis** – Reviewed network and firewall logs to trace the attack vector and assess impact.  
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)** – Structured the analysis and remediation plan across Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.  

## Skills Learned  
- Applying the **NIST CSF** to real-world security incidents.   
- Detecting and analyzing suspicious **network traffic patterns**.   
- Enhancing **incident response planning** and recovery procedures.
